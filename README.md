# chr-freq ![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mohamedhayibor/check-question.svg?branch=master)

This module gives you a command `chr-freq` that counts the character frequencies of a given string. All from the command line.

## Installation
```
  > npm install -g chr-freq
```

Don't forget the "-g" to install it globally. (then you can run chr-freq anywhere)

## Usage
On your terminal:

```
  > chr-freq hey that's a string right there &&&
  // => { h: 4, e: 3, y: 1, t: 5, a: 2, s: 2, r: 3, i: 2, n: 1, g: 2, '&': 3 }

```
Basically: The keyword "chr-freq" and whatever string you want the character frequencies from.

## Raison d'être
Adds more fun to the command-line fun.
